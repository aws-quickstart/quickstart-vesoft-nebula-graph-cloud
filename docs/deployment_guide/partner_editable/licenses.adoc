This Quick Start requires a license for {partner-product-short-name} Enterprise Edition. To use the Quick Start in your production environment, apply for a license by sending an email to inquiry@vesoft.com. When you launch the Quick Start, place the license key in an S3 bucket and specify its location. If you don't have a license, the Quick Start deploys with a trial license. The trial license gives you 3 days of free usage in a non-production environment. After this time, you can upgrade to a production license by following the instructions at https://docs.nebula-graph.io/3.1.0/4.deployment-and-installation/deploy-license/#renew_a_nebula_graph_enterprise_edition_license[Renew license].

There is no cost to use this Quick Start, but you will be billed for any AWS services or resources that this Quick Start deploys. For more information, refer to the https://fwd.aws/rA69w?[AWS Quick Start General Information Guide^].
