.Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/nebulagraph-architecture-diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans three Availability Zones.*
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* An internet gateway to allow internet access for bastion hosts (not shown).*
* A Network Load Balancer for balancing incoming traffic across multiple hosts.*

In the public subnets:

* Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
* A Linux bastion host to allow inbound Secure
Shell (SSH) access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in public and private subnets.*
* A {partner-product-short-name} Explorer server for visualized exploration of {partner-product-short-name} data.

In the private subnets:

* {partner-product-short-name} Graph Service supported by graphd processes. Each graphd process runs in one subnet.
* {partner-product-short-name} Meta Service supported by metad processes. Each metad process runs in one subnet.
* {partner-product-short-name} Storage Service supported by nebula-storaged processes. The storaged processes are distributed in different subnets automatically.
* An Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) storage volume for EC2 instances in each subnet.

[.small]#* The template that deploys this Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
